# Product Management System for Admin Panel

This implementation adds dynamic product display functionality to the admin products page. It connects with the `/api/admin/products` endpoint to fetch and display products after they're successfully added.

## Features Implemented

1. **Dynamic Product Table**
   - Fetches product data from the API
   - Displays products with images, names, quantities, and actions
   - Handles empty states and loading states
   - Supports pagination for large product lists

2. **Product Statistics**
   - Updates product counts in real-time
   - Shows total products, available products, out-of-stock products, and low-stock products

3. **Success Notifications**
   - Shows notification when products are successfully added
   - Automatically refreshes the product list after addition

4. **Search and Filter**
   - Filter products by name, category, or status
   - Preserves filter state between operations

## How It Works

1. When the products page loads, the `fetchProducts()` function is called to get data from `/api/admin/products`
2. The data is rendered in the table with product images, names, and actions
3. When a user adds a new product from the add-product page, they are redirected back to products.html with a success parameter
4. The products page detects this parameter and displays a success notification
5. The product list is automatically refreshed to show the newly added product

## Future Improvements

1. Implement product deletion functionality
2. Add bulk operations (delete, update status)
3. Add sorting options for the product table
4. Implement more advanced filtering options
5. Add export functionality for product data

## Files Modified

1. Page/admin/products.html
2. Page/admin/add-product.html
3. Page/admin/js/product-management.js (new file)
4. Page/admin/css/product-management.css (new file)
